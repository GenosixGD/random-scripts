Scripts with no general theme. If you think you can improve them: go ahead and make a pull request. I'll only be happy if someone makes improvements

# What the scripts do:

### spotify_data_scan.py
Scans spotify data (no way).  
You have to download your data through Spotify account settings, unzip it, and put the script inside the unzipped folder. It will go through your favorite songs and put them in a sorted easy to read list (playlists and automatic metadata assigning to your downloaded songs coming soon)  
There are some comments in the script to help you modify how the output file looks
