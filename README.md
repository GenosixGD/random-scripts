Scripts with no general theme. If you think you can improve them: go ahead and make a pull request. I'll only be happy if someone makes improvements

# What the scripts do:

### Spotify external downloader
WIP, do not use

### sticker-scrape.py
Downloads stickers (stamps) from some PJSK fan website.  
Only downloads the ones with characters, might take a while

### AutoGen
Abandoned code for the job I had, the whole thing is a mess, putting it up here because I spent a lot of time on it, don't want it to just be deleted
